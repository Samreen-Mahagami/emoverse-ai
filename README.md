## 🎯 How It Works

### Student Workflow

1. **Upload**: Student uploads a PDF or image
2. **Process**: Textract extracts text, Comprehend analyzes emotions
3. **Display**: Clean text and sentiment shown to student
4. **Interact**: Student asks questions, Claude answers
5. **Story**: Student requests a story based on content
   - **Like it?** → Saved to preferences
   - **Dislike?** → Claude regenerates with different approach
   - **Still dislike?** → Playwright finds external stories
6. **Quiz**: Auto-generated quiz to test understanding
7. **Track**: All interactions stored in LTM for personalization

### Teacher Workflow

1. **Upload**: Teacher uploads content
2. **Generate**: System creates 30-60 min lesson plan
   - Warm-up activities
   - Main learning activities
   - Extension exercises
   - Assessment methods
3. **Analytics**: View student performance and emotional trends

## 💡 Key Innovation: Long-Term Memory (LTM)

The LTM system is the brain of the platform:

- **Remembers** student preferences and dislikes
- **Tracks** emotional states over time
- **Records** quiz performance and engagement
- **Provides** rich analytics for teachers
- **Enables** truly personalized learning

Stored in DynamoDB for fast, scalable access.

## 🔄 Three-Tier Story Generation

1. **Tier 1**: Claude generates story based on content
2. **Tier 2**: If disliked, Claude regenerates avoiding previous themes
3. **Tier 3**: If still disliked, Playwright searches external story websites

This ensures every student gets a story they enjoy!

## 💰 Cost Estimate

For 100 active students (5 sessions/month each):

- Lambda: ~$50/month
- Bedrock (Claude): ~$200/month
- Textract: ~$150/month
- Other AWS services: ~$105/month

**Total: ~$505/month** or **~$5/student/month**

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ All data encrypted at rest (S3, DynamoDB)
- ✅ IAM roles with least privilege
- ✅ No storage of sensitive PII
- ✅ Age-appropriate content filtering
- ✅ Secure API endpoints

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run integration tests
python tests/test_integration.py

# Test individual components
python -c "from backend.agentcore.memory.ltm_manager import LTMManager; ltm = LTMManager(); print(ltm.get_student_preferences('test'))"
```

## 📈 Monitoring

```bash
# View Lambda logs
sam logs -n StoryGeneratorFunction --tail

# CloudWatch logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/sel-story-generator --follow
```
