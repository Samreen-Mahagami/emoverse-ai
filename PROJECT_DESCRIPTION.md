- **Wait times:** 6-12 months for appointments

### Who Needs This
Students with anxiety, depression, ADHD, autism, behavioral disorders, trauma history, low self-esteem, bullying experiences, or in underserved communities without mental health access.

### Our Solution
✅ 24/7 support when counselors unavailable  
✅ $0.29/student/month vs. $50-200/hour therapy  
✅ Early intervention through pattern detection
